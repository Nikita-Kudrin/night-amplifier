//! Cross-frame reuse of the preview pipeline's estimates.
//!
//! # What this is for
//!
//! `process_preview_frame` computes three things that are *statistical descriptions of
//! the stack* rather than properties of the frame in front of it:
//!
//! - the white-balance multipliers — three numbers, clamped to `[0.5, 2.0]`;
//! - the background model — a 12x12 or 16x16 node grid and its interpolant;
//! - the per-channel median and MAD that the stretch is solved against.
//!
//! The frame they describe is a running mean over N subs, so between two consecutive
//! renders it moves by 1/N. Recomputing all three every frame is most of what the linear
//! half of the render thread costs: `preview_pipeline_benchmark` puts the whole of
//! `process_preview_frame` at 11.2 ms on an IMX464-shaped frame and these three at
//! **6.4 ms of it**, and that is with Community's bilinear background — Pro's RBF
//! estimate is several times more expensive again.
//!
//! What is *not* cached is everything that touches pixels: neutralisation still
//! multiplies, the model is still subtracted, the black point is still removed. Only the
//! estimates are reused, so every frame is still fully corrected.
//!
//! # When a cached analysis is wrong
//!
//! Four conditions, and the depth rule is the one that is easy to get wrong.
//!
//! - **Live view.** With `showing_stack` false every frame is a different image, not a
//!   refinement of the same one, and there is nothing to reuse.
//! - **A settings change.** [`AnalysisKey`] fingerprints every setting the three
//!   estimates read. Floats go in as bit patterns rather than through `PartialEq`, so a
//!   NaN that arrived over JSON compares equal to itself and cannot pin the cache open.
//! - **A shape change.** Binning, an ROI change or a superpixel toggle all land here.
//!   `BackgroundModel::subtract_from` would refuse a mismatched frame anyway, but
//!   failing at the key is a decision rather than an error path.
//! - **Stack growth.** This is the subtle one. MAD falls as `1/sqrt(N)`, so what moves
//!   the statistics is not how many frames have passed but the *relative* change in N.
//!   Going from 1 sub to 2 halves the noise; going from 140 to 141 does not move it at
//!   all. A fixed frame-count TTL would therefore be far too slow exactly where the
//!   stretch is changing fastest — the first few seconds of a stack, which is also when
//!   the user is watching it most closely. [`DEPTH_GROWTH`] refreshes on proportional
//!   growth instead, which recomputes every frame at the start and settles to roughly
//!   every N/4 once the stack is deep.
//!
//! [`MAX_AGE_FRAMES`] caps the reuse regardless, so a stack that stops growing — every
//! frame rejected by the gate, say — still refreshes against a sky that is still moving.
